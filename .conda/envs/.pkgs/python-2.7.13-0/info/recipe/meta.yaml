about:
    description: 'Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted,
        dynamic

        programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code

        readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in

        fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or

        Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs

        on both a small and large scale.
